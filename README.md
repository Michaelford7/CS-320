CS 320 – Michael Ford

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure my code is functional by building and running detailed JUnit tests that match every project requirement. I also check coverage reports in Eclipse to confirm that each method is tested. To keep my programs secure, I use validation to prevent bad or incomplete data from being added, such as rejecting null IDs or strings that exceed their limits.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by breaking down the requirements into smaller, testable goals. In the Contact Service project, I focused on what users needed most — reliable ways to store, update, and remove contacts. I made sure the program responded correctly to user actions while protecting data from errors or duplication.

How do I approach designing software?
My design process begins with organization and simplicity. I like to design small classes with clear responsibilities and test each part separately before combining them. I also use version control to track progress and keep code changes safe. Each project has taught me that clean, modular design leads to easier testing, faster debugging, and more secure software overall.
